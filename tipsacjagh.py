#Challenge
##Create a function that accepts an input and determines all factors of the number.

integer= int(input("Say a number"))
print (integer)
#first take inputs. check
#Second somehow make a list that has the factors of such number in it. 
#Third make a filter for that list to only print out the largest/highest/greatest factors?
